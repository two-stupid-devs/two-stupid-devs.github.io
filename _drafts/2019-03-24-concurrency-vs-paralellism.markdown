# We're going to open a restaurant. 

And like any restaurant, we need to have a well organised kitchen to be able to respond to requests to prepare and cook meals as efficiently as possible.

The kitchen we've been given to use has a few essential pieces of equiptment:
- An oven
- A microwave
- A freezer
- Some preperation surfaces

It also has a list of pending orders that have been received from the waiting staff and need to be prepared.

And last but certainly not least, we have our Chef. The recruiting agent told me his name is Colin.

[ Colin. ]

Our Chefs job is reasonably simple. He has to follow sets of instructions, called recipes, to prepare the different meals. Some of these steps require the Chef to perform some task, such as cutting up potatoes. Others required him to wait whilst a particular process completes, such as putting the potatoes in the oven and waiting for them to bake.
